Description: A simple driver that reads binary data created by the ASD Inc.
    portable spectrometer instruments, such as the FieldSpec (for more information
    about these instruments, see http://www.asdi.com/products/fieldspec-
    spectroradiometers). Spectral data can be extracted from the ASD files as raw
    (DN), white reference, radiance, or reflectance. Additionally, the metadata
    information contained in the ASD file header can also be accessed.
